I built a FAQ-based chatbot using Python, NLP, and Streamlit. It reads questions and answers from a CSV file and uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to find the best-matching answer to a user’s query. The chatbot has a simple UI where users can upload their own FAQ dataset or use the default one. While it’s rule-based, it demonstrates NLP concepts like tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vector similarity. If extended, it can integrate fuzzy matching, embeddings, and real-time databases to handle more complex conversations
